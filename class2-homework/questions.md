#1. formulate a research question for your dataset

#2. write the steps detailing your preliminary idea of how to answer it (can be very brief).
Step 1: Get the data in a format I can work with, decide on a technology
Step 2: Prepare data for analysis, perform exploratory data analysis and find outliers, obvious discrepancies, averages, standard deviations, etc
Step 3: Visualize my data and its correlations to further expand my knowledge of my data
Step 4: Based on previous findings, choose the algorithms to extract a model from my data. Prepare Training & Test dataset
Step 5: Create Models for predicting my final values and perform testing
Step 6: Measure performance of the Models and choose best Model
Step 7: Present my conclusions. If the result was a failure, explain whether itâ€™s impossible to predict it or what do we miss in order to improve our results.
