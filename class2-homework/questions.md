#1. formulate a research question for your dataset

#2. write the steps detailing your preliminary idea of how to answer it (can be very brief).

Step 1: Get the data in a format I can work with
Step 2: Decide which are the best tools to answer my question and prepare them
Step 3: Prepare data for analysis, perform exploratory data analysis and find outliers, obvious discrepancies, averages, standard deviations, etc
Step 4: Visualize my data and its correlations to further expand my knowledge of my data
Step 5: Based on previous findings, choose the algorithms to extract a model from my data. Prepare Training & Test dataset
Step 6: Create Models for predicting my final values and perform testing
Step 7: Validate and measure performance of the Models and choose best Model
Step 8: Present my conclusions. If the result was a failure, explain whether itâ€™s impossible to predict it or what do we miss in order to improve our results.
Step 9: If we have a conclusive and successfull model, industrialize and offer it as a service
